5. Sample application

   2. How do I update the screen
      1. How does state work?
         1. Treat states as readonly. (new objects not update objects) (talk about nested objects) (immer https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer)
            1. https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/updating-objects-in-state#why-is-mutating-state-not-recommended-in-react
            2. Updating arrays (spread or use array inbuilt funcs (list exceptions))
            3. Always define your dependency array
      2. Event handlers
         1. How does batching work
      3. inbuilt Hooks
         1. https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react
      4. Custom hooks

      5. React api components

      6. Effects
         1. when to use them
            1. https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#how-to-remove-unnecessary-effects
         2. Why we might not want to use them
         3. Use memo instead?
   3. Sharing data between components
      1. https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/sharing-state-between-components
      2. https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context
